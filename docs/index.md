# Overview
Welcome to Orchid!

The Orchid network enables a decentralized virtual private network (VPN),
allowing users to buy bandwidth from a decentralized pool of service providers.

To do this, Orchid uses an ERC-20 utility token called OXT, a new VPN protocol
for token-incentivized bandwidth proxying, and smart-contracts with algorithmic
advertising and payment functions. Orchid's users connect to bandwidth sellers
using a provider directory, and they pay using probabilistic nanopayments so
Ethereum transaction fees on packets are acceptably low.

# Vision
Our vision is to enable secure access to the internet for everyone, everywhere.
