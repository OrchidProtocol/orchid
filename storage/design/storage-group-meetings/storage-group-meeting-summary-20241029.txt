Orchid Storage Technical Meeting: Discussing process and deliverables

1. **Litepaper Refinements:**
   - A participant reported adding comments to the litepaper for clarity and deeper technical exploration.
   - A plan was established to consolidate comments and improve readability by restructuring dense sections.
   - Goals for streamlining the document into a cohesive narrative were discussed, including turning it into actionable specifications.

2. **Smart Contract Considerations:**
   - Discussion centered on defining the scope and API for blockchain smart contracts related to storage.
   - Questions included:
     - Access to historical data by contracts.
     - Cost structures for verifying multiple storage events concurrently.
   - Suggestions to identify experts for resolving ambiguities, though basic research might clarify many points.

3. **Collaborative Documentation Process:**
   - Proposed breaking work into smaller, actionable deliverables to accelerate progress.
   - The current focus is on the blockchain story within the litepaper, which outlines settlement, bonded commitments, and self-audit mechanisms.
   - Establishing a workflow for creating visible, milestone-based deliverables to maintain stakeholder engagement.

4. **Technical Strategies:**
   - Emphasis on "working backward" from constraints imposed by blockchain contracts to refine system components such as erasure coding and nanopayment integration.
   - Twin-coding, detailed in the litepaper, was noted as critical for optimizing repair costs.
