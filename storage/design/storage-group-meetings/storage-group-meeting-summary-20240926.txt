Orchid Storage Technical Meeting: Provider and Cohort Core Interactions

---

#### **Key Themes:**

1. **Provider Stories and Core Interactions:**
   - The meeting began by structuring the provider's journey through decentralized data storage. The provider's role involves:
     - Advertising storage capabilities via staking mechanisms.
     - Accepting storage tasks based on incoming Rate Certificates (RCs).
     - Validating RCs to ensure they are credible commitments.
     - Performing bandwidth transactions while assembling data blocks.
     - Constructing cryptographic commitments (e.g., KZG) to ensure auditability.

2. **Cohort Mechanics:**
   - A "cohort" represents a group of storage providers collaborating to maintain data reliability.
   - Interactions within cohorts include:
     - Sharing metadata about members.
     - Identifying incomplete or invalid commitments during audits.
     - Supporting data reconstruction using erasure coding.
   - Providers are incentivized to participate in repairs and verification, enhancing data durability.

3. **Operational Phases:**
   - **Phase 1:** Core interaction between a provider and a client:
     - Focused on direct commitments and bandwidth exchanges without external dependencies.
   - **Phase 2:** Integration of cohort-level interactions:
     - Handling failures and repairs collaboratively.
     - Incentive alignment ensures honest provider participation in the cohort's repair processes.
   - **Phase 3:** Reconstruction and repair:
     - Providers execute client-signed recovery tasks even in the clientâ€™s absence.
     - Cohorts employ erasure and twin-coding schemes for efficient block regeneration.

4. **Document Structure and Levels of Detail:**
   - There was a consensus to separate design and incentive motivations from detailed technical specifications (the "spec").
   - Abstract concepts like Rate Certificates, Bonded Commitments, and Erasure Coding need discrete sections for clarity.
