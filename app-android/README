This is the Android client for Orchid. To build it, you need to have zipalign, and the Android NDK installed--with either ANDROID_NDK_HOME or ANDROID_HOME (if using the SDK) correctly configured--in addition to the usual developer dependencies for Orchid; you then should just have to run "make" (we do not support Android Studio).
